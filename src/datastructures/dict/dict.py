Dictionary
- It is used to store key-value pairs
- A dictionary is a collection which is changeable, ordered, and don't allow duplicates
- The basic template of list is:
     dict = {
     "a":"AA",
     1:"1",
     }
Defined using curly braces {}.
Each item is a key: value pair.
Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, tuples).
Values can be of any type (string, list, object, even another dictionary).

How ordering works:
The order is based on when a key was first inserted.
